# Privacy Policy

No user data is collected, stored by the developer (stenar, pgc d.o.o.) or shared or sold to any third parties outside of the user's phone.

SMSLoc does not contain advertising and does not use user location for advertising or analytics.

Location data

Location is only shared with another phone if that phone number is approved (whitelisted) by the user in SMSLoc. All location requests are made manually via SMS and are seen by the phone owner.

The SMSLoc application is designed to be used outdoors with poor or no internet connectivity when not actively using the application. Therefore, SMSLoc requires background location permission so that it can always respond hands-free to an SMS request with the exact location while the user is engaged in their outdoor activity or being in distress.

SMS data

To be able to work offline without internet even with poor phone signal in the mountains, deep valleys or canyons. SMSLoc uses short SMS messages to communicate between whitelisted phones. It is basically a user interface to send exactly the same information manually by the user with the added help of a hands-free automatic response when/if the user is unable to respond manually.

Types of SMS messages that SMSLoc listens to or replies to:
"Loc?"
"Loc:lat,lon,alt,time,speed,battery,predefined_message"

## Terms of use

SMSLoc can be used by whitelisted friends to locate each other.

The application is used at the user's own risk and without warranty of any kind.
