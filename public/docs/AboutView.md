# About

Locate your friend and be found via SMS in areas with no internet or poor connectivity.

## Offline

SMSLoc can be used offline by whitelisted friends to check each other's exact location at any time. It is designed for outdoor use when hiking, climbing, canyoning, paragliding etc.

SMSLoc requires SMS and background location permission so that it can always respond hands-free to an SMS request with the exact location while the user is engaged in their outdoor activity or being in distress.

## Need help

Send short, predefined messages **along with your location**.
